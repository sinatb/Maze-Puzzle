# The Office
A simple puzzle game in Unity. The player is put inside a maze with no apparent escape and needs to find a way out by solving different puzzles.

## Puzzles
Currently, 8 Puzzles have been implemented. To open some of the doors the player needs to solve puzzles. 3 riddles, 2 logical puzzles, and 2 Pattern recognition puzzles.


## TODO
* Adding PCG for map generation
* Improving the styling of UI
* Improving the abstraction in puzzle code
* Adding support for timed puzzles
* Adding music and sound to all parts of the game
* Adding more story bits for the story puzzle
* Adding more items and craftables

Critical bug: The switch model was deleted :)
